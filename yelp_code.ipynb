The place is a nice Lebanese restaurant and owners are really nice and helpful. Food is very good. But the thing I liked the most is chicken shawarma which is the best I had in Philadelphia till now. Chicken shawarma wraps are amazing and very close to authentic. Sfehas and fatayer are really very delicious. Highly recommended.   \n",

It was absolutely delicious. I have a severe dairy allergy and the owner was able to accommodate me. This is another restaurant that I can add to my list of great go-to places in Malvern! The owner and employees are super friendly and the food is delicious.   \n",

Very very salty food. \\nNot much on the menu. Looks like they need extra people to help them as they were slow. And expensive for the quality of food.   \n",

              "8877  Went here yesterday for help with a bad virus giving me flu-like symptoms, I'm not sure that I'll ever come back to this location for any medical concern. It has bad reviews but it's right next to my house. I'm very sick, and felt unsafe driving to West nash for my PCP. Front desk staff was kind and they got me in relatively quickly, but they were unprepared with low stock on tests and swabs. The only kind of tests they did have were the kinds with 50-70% accuracy. (I had already tested neg for covid at Nissan)\\nThe doctor did not listen to my complaints, she did not validate my concerns and she rushed me so that i could not think of what i needed to ask or disclose. She asked what symptoms were bothering me the most. I told her aches and pains w/fever were bad and worst was my chest burning and an urge to cough and shortness of breath preventing me from sleeping. She said \"well i listened to your lungs and didn't hear any wheezing\". I had been running a 101 fever on and off since symptoms began but wasn't at the time i went in, is that why she didn't take the patient seriously?\\nLater that night fever back, audible wheezing, by this morning the infection has fully spread to my chest. I feel horrible and i wasted my money coming here. I paid for no medical care whatsoever. \\nThe reason for a one star review is any doctor who is unable to listen to the patient is also unable to provide medical care. \\nFor anyone reading this, remember YOU are the authority on your own body. You are the one experiencing your symptoms. You know how you feel. Find a doctor who respects that.   \n",

I went in six weeks ago or so and received care for a bad cough/cold. Six weeks later, the cough hadn't gone away and I was experiencing new symptoms so I went back. I was sent to the Madison location to get a chest xray, where I checked in and waited for almost an hour before asking when I would be seen.The staff somehow forgot that I was waiting, even though I was the only person in the waiting room. I received no diagnosis, was told to take Ibuprofen and follow up in a few days if I wasn't feeling better. I did follow up, and they told me I would have to come in and pay for another appointment if I wanted to do a follow up. Appointments are MORE expensive with insurance. It's a racket.   \n",

It has bad reviews but it's right next to my house. I'm very sick, and felt unsafe driving to West nash for my PCP. Front desk staff was kind and they got me in relatively quickly, but they were unprepared with low stock on tests and swabs. The only kind of tests they did have were the kinds with 50-70% accuracy. (I had already tested neg for covid at Nissan)\\nThe doctor did not listen to my complaints, she did not validate my concerns and she rushed me so that i could not think of what i needed to ask or disclose. She asked what symptoms were bothering me the most. I told her aches and pains w/fever were bad and worst was my chest burning and an urge to cough and shortness of breath preventing me from sleeping. She said \"well i listened to your lungs and didn't hear any wheezing\". I had been running a 101 fever on and off since symptoms began but wasn't at the time i went in, is that why she didn't take the patient seriously?\\nLater that night fever back, audible wheezing, by this morning the infection has fully spread to my chest. I feel horrible and i wasted my money coming here. I paid for no medical care whatsoever. \\nThe reason for a one star review is any doctor who is unable to listen to the patient is also unable to provide medical care. \\nFor anyone reading this, remember YOU are the authority on your own body. You are the one experiencing your symptoms. You know how you feel. Find a doctor who respects that.</td>\n",

Food is very good. But the thing I liked the most is chicken shawarma which is the best I had in Philadelphia till now. Chicken shawarma wraps are amazing and very close to authentic. Sfehas and fatayer are really very delicious. Highly recommended.   \n",

Food is very good. But the thing I liked the most is chicken shawarma which is the best I had in Philadelphia till now. Chicken shawarma wraps are amazing and very close to authentic. Sfehas and fatayer are really very delicious. Highly recommended.   \n",

The place is a nice Lebanese restaurant and owners are really nice and helpful. Food is very good. But the thing I liked the most is chicken shawarma which is the best I had in Philadelphia till now. Chicken shawarma wraps are amazing and very close to authentic. Sfehas and fatayer are really very delicious. Highly recommended.   \n",

It was absolutely delicious. I have a severe dairy allergy and the owner was able to accommodate me. This is another restaurant that I can add to my list of great go-to places in Malvern! The owner and employees are super friendly and the food is delicious.   \n",

Very very salty food. \\nNot much on the menu. Looks like they need extra people to help them as they were slow. And expensive for the quality of food.   \n",

Not only are they clueless about any form of treatment, but their attitude is unnecessarily rude. Also, having been the only people in the clinic to wait 2 hours to finally be seen is absurd. Honestly, this place should be audited.   \n",
              "8877  Went here yesterday for help with a bad virus giving me flu-like symptoms, I'm not sure that I'll ever come back to this location for any medical concern. It has bad reviews but it's right next to my house. I'm very sick, and felt unsafe driving to West nash for my PCP. Front desk staff was kind and they got me in relatively quickly, but they were unprepared with low stock on tests and swabs. The only kind of tests they did have were the kinds with 50-70% accuracy. (I had already tested neg for covid at Nissan)\\nThe doctor did not listen to my complaints, she did not validate my concerns and she rushed me so that i could not think of what i needed to ask or disclose. She asked what symptoms were bothering me the most. I told her aches and pains w/fever were bad and worst was my chest burning and an urge to cough and shortness of breath preventing me from sleeping. She said \"well i listened to your lungs and didn't hear any wheezing\". I had been running a 101 fever on and off since symptoms began but wasn't at the time i went in, is that why she didn't take the patient seriously?\\nLater that night fever back, audible wheezing, by this morning the infection has fully spread to my chest. I feel horrible and i wasted my money coming here. I paid for no medical care whatsoever. \\nThe reason for a one star review is any doctor who is unable to listen to the patient is also unable to provide medical care. \\nFor anyone reading this, remember YOU are the authority on your own body. You are the one experiencing your symptoms. You know how you feel. Find a doctor who respects that.   \n",

I went in six weeks ago or so and received care for a bad cough/cold. Six weeks later, the cough hadn't gone away and I was experiencing new symptoms so I went back. I was sent to the Madison location to get a chest xray, where I checked in and waited for almost an hour before asking when I would be seen.The staff somehow forgot that I was waiting, even though I was the only person in the waiting room. I received no diagnosis, was told to take Ibuprofen and follow up in a few days if I wasn't feeling better. I did follow up, and they told me I would have to come in and pay for another appointment if I wanted to do a follow up. Appointments are MORE expensive with insurance. It's a racket.   \n",

Front desk staff was kind and they got me in relatively quickly, but they were unprepared with low stock on tests and swabs. The only kind of tests they did have were the kinds with 50-70% accuracy. (I had already tested neg for covid at Nissan)\\nThe doctor did not listen to my complaints, she did not validate my concerns and she rushed me so that i could not think of what i needed to ask or disclose. She asked what symptoms were bothering me the most. I told her aches and pains w/fever were bad and worst was my chest burning and an urge to cough and shortness of breath preventing me from sleeping. She said \"well i listened to your lungs and didn't hear any wheezing\". I had been running a 101 fever on and off since symptoms began but wasn't at the time i went in, is that why she didn't take the patient seriously?\\nLater that night fever back, audible wheezing, by this morning the infection has fully spread to my chest. I feel horrible and i wasted my money coming here. I paid for no medical care whatsoever. \\nThe reason for a one star review is any doctor who is unable to listen to the patient is also unable to provide medical care. \\nFor anyone reading this, remember YOU are the authority on your own body.
